# EDA for eCommerce Transactions Dataset

## Overview
This project contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for an eCommerce transactions dataset. The dataset includes information about:
- Customers (CustomerID, Region, etc.)
- Products (ProductID, Category, Price)
- Transactions (TransactionID, Quantity, TotalValue, etc.)

## Files
- **Tulluri_Kinnera_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with EDA code.
- **Tulluri_Kinnera_EDA.pdf**: PDF report summarizing key insights.

## Steps to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Open the notebook and run the cells.

## Insights
1. Europe and Asia account for over 70% of the customer base.
2. Electronics dominate sales, followed by home appliances.
3. Peak sales occur in November and December due to the festive season.
4. Products P1234 and P5678 are the top sellers.
5. Most transactions involve smaller quantities (1â€“3 items).

## Lookalike Model: Customer Recommendations
This project builds a Lookalike Model to recommend the top 3 similar customers for each customer in the dataset.

### Files:
- `Tulluri_Kinnera_Lookalike.ipynb`: Notebook with the implementation.
- `Tulluri_Kinnera_Lookalike.csv`: CSV file containing the recommendations.

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook.
